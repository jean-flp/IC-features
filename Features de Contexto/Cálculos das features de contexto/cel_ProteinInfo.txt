6239.ZK945.9.1	lov-1	3284	Location of vulva defective 1; Required for two aspects of male mating behavior: response to hermaphrodite contact and vulva location. Acts in the same pathway as pkd-2 and atp-2 in response behavior. May be required for ciliary targeting of pkd-2.
6239.ZK970.1b.1	nep-26	807	NEPrilysin metallopeptidase family.
6239.ZK970.2d.1	clpp-1	221	ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit 1, mitochondrial; Clp cleaves peptides in various proteins in a process that requires ATP hydrolysis. Clp may be responsible for a fairly general and central housekeeping function rather than for the degradation of specific substrates; Belongs to the peptidase S14 family.
6239.ZK970.3.1	mdt-22	157	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 22; Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene- specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors (By similarity).
6239.ZK970.4.2	vha-9	121	Probable V-type proton ATPase subunit F; Subunit of the peripheral V1 complex of vacuolar ATPase essential for assembly or catalytic function (Probable). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells (Probable). Required along with other vacuolar ATPase components for the removal of protein aggregates which form in immature oocytes in the distal gonad. This removal occurs as the oocytes mature and move to the proximal gonad, is triggered by the introduction of sperm through mating and occurs before fertilization. The introduction of  [...] 
6239.ZK970.5.1	gcy-4	1136	Receptor-type guanylate cyclase gcy-4; Guanylate cyclase involved in the production of the second messenger cGMP (By similarity). Regulates chemotaxis responses toward Br(1-) and I(1-) salt ions in ASE right (ASER) sensory neuron.
6239.ZK970.6.1	gcy-5	1122	Receptor-type guanylate cyclase gcy-5; Guanylate cyclase involved in the production of the second messenger cGMP (By similarity). Unlike other guanylate cyclases expressed in ASE neurons, may not play a role in chemotaxis responses to salt ions mediated by ASE sensory neurons.
